# Exploratory Data Analysis of Apartment Prices (Ukraine)

## Project overview
This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of an apartment listings dataset.
The analysis focuses on residential real estate prices, apartment characteristics, and market patterns
in Kyiv and selected surrounding cities.

The project was completed as part of a data analytics course and demonstrates practical work with
data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory analysis, and hypothesis formulation using Python.

## Objectives
The main goals of the project are:

1. Perform initial data cleaning and preprocessing.
2. Create a new feature representing the price per square meter.
3. Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand price distributions and key trends.
4. Identify the most common number of rooms in apartments for sale in Kyiv.
5. Calculate the average price of one-room apartments in Irpin.
6. Analyze the popularity of studio apartments.
7. Formulate a hypothesis about the presence of multimodal distribution in apartment prices in Kyiv
   and discuss possible reasons behind it.

## Dataset
The dataset contains apartment listings with features such as:
- location (city / district),
- total price,
- apartment area,
- number of rooms,
- apartment type.

The original data was loaded from a CSV file and processed using **pandas**.

## Tools and technologies
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib / seaborn
- ydata-profiling
- Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab)

---

## Key steps
- Data cleaning and type correction
- Feature engineering (price per square meter)
- Descriptive statistics
- Visual exploration of distributions
- Comparative analysis between cities
- Hypothesis formulation based on observed patterns

---

## Results
The analysis reveals clear differences in price levels depending on location and apartment type.
Evidence suggests that apartment prices in Kyiv may exhibit a multimodal distribution,
potentially driven by differences between districts, building types, and proximity to infrastructure.

## Notes
This repository focuses on exploratory analysis.
The project emphasizes analytical reasoning and interpretation rather than predictive modeling.
